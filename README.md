a2-rana-elite development is hosted at the

## Introduction

The Rana Elite Controller for the Apple II is a floppy disk controller
compatible with the Apple Disk II controller, but with additional features.
The Elite can control four drives (vs. two for the Disk II controller), and
by virtue of having more firmware, can automatically boot either 13-sector
or 16-sector disks.
